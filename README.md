# Alfred Workflows used by me

## IMG to JPEG

This is a simple alfred workflow that converts images in .webp and .heic to .jpeg fully automatically and then deletes the original files if required.

This workflow is based on `HEIC to JPEG`: https://alfred.app/workflows/alfredapp/heic-to-jpeg/

### Requirements

Since this workflow uses the `mogrify` tool from the imagemagick package, imagemagick must be installed before using the workflow:

`brew install imagemagick`
